Let me get something straight first before I go further into introducing myself, if you did a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/#q=Shane+Howell&safe=off\" target=\"_blank\">Google</a> search for my name and are looking for the MMA fighter then you have wandered into the wrong website but feel free to take a look around anyways. And don’t act like you’ve never googled yourself either because we all know you have.</p><p>I am a Web Developer that loves all things web (well, almost all things… i’m looking at you 90′s tables). There’s not a day that goes by where I don’t learn something new and interesting whether it’s project related, life related, job related or just plain related to anything. I have a thirst for the thing called knowledge, as should everyone!</p><p>Here are a few of the things that I've been using lately on my project builds: <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/\" target=\"_blank\">ReactJS</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/trendyminds/pura\" target=\"_blank\">Pura</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/postcss\" target=\"_blank\">PostCSS</a>, <a href=\"https://yarnpkg.com/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Yarn</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts\" target=\"_blank\">NPM Scripts</a>, <a href=\"https://buildwithcraft.com/\" target=\"_blank\">CraftCMS</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Github</a>, <a href=\"https://www.zenhub.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Zenhub</a>, <a href=\"https://www.vagrantup.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Vagrant</a> and the list can go on so I'll end it here.</p>",
